						<h2>The Background</h2>
						<p>Nowadays, almost everybody owns a cellular phone that can connect to the internet - including 70% of the homeless population in Santa Clara County. These phones can provide them access to resources they wouldn&#39t have otherwise, such as information on food services, medical help, and other aid. They also serve as the sole means by which a homeless person can be contacted, as they don&#39t have a static home address or home phone.</p>

						<br>

						<h2>The Problem</h2>
						<p>Unfortunately, there are very few applications built specifically for the homeless population. This hackathon aims to change that. In just one day, you can create a smartphone app or website that could aid the homeless for years to come. We&#39ve listed some projects students worked on at last year&#39s Hack for the Homeless for inspiration, but feel free to come up with your own genius ideas. So come out and join us, and make a difference in the lives of the Bay Area&#39s homeless population.</p>

						<h2>OPPORTUNITY: Integration With CTA Phones</h2>
						<p>The Community Technology Alliance is offering the unique opportunity to have standout apps come preloaded on all phones in their <a href="http://www.ctagroup.org/what-we-do/projects-services/mobile-4-all/">Mobile For All</a> campaign. These phones will be distributed to impoverished individuals in the US who would otherwise not have access to cellular services. This is a huge initiative that aims to increase the self-sufficiency of low income and homeless individuals, and the opportunity to get your app included in their phone program will really cement your accomplishments.</p>

						<br>

						<h2>CASE STUDY: Finding Health Clinics</h2> 
						<p>A team created an app that allowed the user to find a free or low-cost clinic that suited their needs. The app allowed the user to refine their search based on the following criteria: what population is served, location, hours, and services provided. The app interfaced with a database to search for clinics that met the criteria. Future enhancements to the app are set to include: Displaying results on a map relative to the user&#39s current location, and showing the user the closest results by both distance and time on public transit.</p>

						<br>

						<h2>CASE STUDY: Food Notifications</h2> 
						<p>Last year, a team created an app that provided the user with information about free meals being offered near them, at given times. For example, if the nearest location serving lunch opened at 12:00, the user would receive a notification at 11:30 to notify them, along with the next two nearest lunch services. The app interfaced with a database to find organizations serving food. This app displayed the results on a map, relative to the user&#39s current location. Future enhancements are set to include showing the user the closest results by both distance and time on public transit.</p>
