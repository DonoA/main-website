            <p>There are a number of projects that attendees can work on for the benefit of the homeless, and we've listed the details of each below. On the day of the hackathon, there will be an information session where people from the homelessness organizations will talk about what they want, and answer any questions you might have.</p>

			<h4>Project One: <strong>Finding Health Clinics </strong></h4>
			<p>In this project, the team will create an app that allows the user to find a free or low-cost clinic that suits their needs.  The app should at minimum allow the user to refine their search based on the following criteria:  what population is served, location, hours, and services provided.  The app must interface with a database to search for clinics that meet the criteria; a sample database will be provided.  Possible enhancements to the app include:  Displaying results on a map relative to the user’s current location, and showing the user the closest results by both distance and time on public transit.</p>

			<h4>Project Two: <strong>Food Notifications </strong></h4>
			<p>In this project, the team will create an app that provides the user with information about the free meals being offered near them, at appropriate times.  For example, if the nearest location serving lunch serves at 12:00, the user would receive a notification at 11:30 reminding them about that service, and perhaps the next two nearest lunch services.  The app must interface with a database to find organizations serving food; a sample database will be provided.  This app should display results on a map, relative to the user’s current location.  Possible enhancements would include showing the user the closest results by both distance and time on public transit.</p>

			<h4>Project Three: <strong>Medical Reminders </strong></h4>
			<p>In this project, the team will create an app that provides the user with reminders relevant to their health.  The app should allow the user to set reminders to do the following:  take medication, fill their prescription, attend a doctor’s appointment, or make a doctor’s appointment.  In its basic form, this would be a stand-alone app on the user’s phone.  A possible enhancement would be to create a web interface for doctors that allow them to update the reminders on a user’s phone.  Another possible enhancement would be to add a confirmation functionality that allowed the user to confirm that they had e.g. taken their medication, and sent an email to a specified email address. </p>
