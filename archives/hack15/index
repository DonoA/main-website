            <!--<p> (This section is where we'll put a short, pithy spiel on what the event is all about. This paragraph should probably have some information about homelessness, and what can be done to help.)   </p>
            <p>Students and faculty at Santa Clara University have partnered with local homelessness organizations, who have told us of a number of different <a href="projects.html">projects</a> that we could do to help the homeless. </p>

	     <p> 	Nowadays, almost everybody owns a smartphone that can connect to the internet – including a large and growing number of homeless people. These phones can provide them access to resources they wouldn't have otherwise, such as information on food services, medical help, and other aid. They also serve as the sole means by which a homeless person can be contacted, as they don't have a static home address or home phone. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Unfortunately, there are very few applications built specifically for homeless people. This hackathon aims to change that: in just one day, we can create smartphone apps or websites that will aid the homeless for years to come. We've listed the specific projects you can work on in our projects section – or, if you've got an idea for a helpful project of your own, you can work on that instead. So come out and join us, and make a difference in the lives of local homeless people!
