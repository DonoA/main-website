                            <p class="center">Sanah is one of the activities coordinator for ACM-W. She is a Junior majoring in Computer Engineering. When she is not coding, she enjoys trying new restaurants, going to the beach and doing BuzzFeed quizzes. Sanah loves ACM-W because as a female in engineering it’s easy to feel outnumbered by the boys; this club is a great way to both find networking opportunities and get to know some smart, driven women. Neesha and Sanah are really excited to plan some fun and educational activities for ACM-W this year!</p>

Along with ACM-W, she is involved with Intandesh and the peer adviser program. Neesha loves to shop, work out, and eat carbs in her free time, as well as spend loads of time with her family and friends. She is an energetic gal with a passion for laughing and having fun! This year, she would love to see ACM-W continue to strengthen its identity as a community of women in computing willing to help one other reach her goals in the classroom and beyond. </p>
